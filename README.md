# Pickaxe-Effects

Growing up, I've played tons of Minecraft Prison servers and I've always wanted to make one of the Pickaxe Enchantments. This is my attempt!
The purpose is to mine blocks in 3x3 shape.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alexchsieh/Pickaxe-Effects.git
```

## Compiling
compile the code as a jar executable by using build artifacts in intellij

## Future Updates
Planning on making the blocks go automatically into your inventory working with Minecraft default enchants such as Fortune/Unbreaking
